Conclusions
In evaluating the test's impact on revenue, it's evident that the price increase has been successful. However, before proceeding with a permanent change, several considerations beyond short-term revenue should be taken into account.
On the negative side, approximately 25% of customers are lost due to the price increase. This loss could potentially impact growth channels, especially those reliant on word-of-mouth. Friend-referral, which often serves as a proxy for word-of-mouth, has shown strong performance and should be carefully considered.
Conversely, higher revenue per user enables increased investment in marketing channels, such as higher bids for ads. This strategic advantage could lead to expanding the customer base and increasing total revenue over the long term.
Additional insights include:
Friend-referral stands out as the most effective channel. Enhancing its visibility through UI/UX improvements could further boost revenue.
Following referrals, Facebook and Google ads demonstrate higher revenue per user compared to other channels, as expected. Notably, SEO also performs well and represents a cost-effective opportunity for profit growth.
Mobile traffic generates higher revenue per user than web traffic. Given the rising trend in mobile traffic, leveraging this platform more effectively could lead to increased profitability. Increasing bids for mobile ads might be beneficial.
iOS users exhibit higher revenue per user than Android users, likely due to less price sensitivity. Exploring potential UI/UX differences between the platforms could provide further insights.
Revenue per user varies significantly across different segments, suggesting opportunities to tailor products to different price points.
Understanding these insights can inform strategic decisions moving forward, ensuring that the company maximizes revenue while balancing customer retention and growth opportunities across various channels and user segments.
